The pictures represented in Firebase remote config are stored in Firebase storage on the same account.
To control image visibility just togle 'isHidden' value for selected picture in the remote config dashboard and publish changes.
To change priority of showing, run the app on two emulators, first emulator should have English language set as default, second emulator- other 
language, expected behavior is that two first images must be diferent for each device.
